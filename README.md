# citEtravel collection

A collection of basic HTML webpages themed for different cities of the World. This is an indiviual, self-engineered project designed to get myself more comfortable with HTML/CSS languages and back-end web development.

## Getting Started

Currently, to view this webpage, select a city and download it's corresponding .html page along with the style.css file. Then download all the images for that page. To run these on your local machine, ensure you have all your files in the same location and double click on the html file.

A live hosting has not yet been developed for this project.
